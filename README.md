# DCT2_Image_Compression_C
This project has:
- An implementation of a static class to calculate DCT2 transformation over a squared matrix;
- An implementation of a wrapper to use FFTW to calculate DCT2 over a squared matrix;
- An implementation of a static class to generate random squared matrices an time the execution of a function over them.
